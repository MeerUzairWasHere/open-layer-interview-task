# React OpenLayers Map with Drawing Tools

This project is a React application built with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring an interactive map powered by OpenLayers. Users can add points, lines, and polygons on the map and also calculate measurements like area and length.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Render a dynamic map using OpenLayers, allowing users to explore and interact with various map layers.
  
- **Drawing Tools**: Implement drawing functionalities using OpenLayers interactions to add points, lines, and polygons to the map.

- **Measurement Calculations** (Optional): Enable users to measure distances (for lines) and areas (for polygons) directly on the map.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Front-end library for building UI components.
  
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
  
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript providing static typing.
  
- **OpenLayers**: Library for interactive maps and geospatial data visualization.
